# vSlice
The goal of vSlice is to make a program to allow for variable layer height slicing done directly from gcode files. 

## Current goals:
 - Finish the actual file output and variable layer height slicing
 - Support for multiple .gcode outputs (only cura is currently supported)
 - Accurate printing time estimates

## Warnings:

Currently the program is far from finished and **NOT** tested on any machines. Use at your own risk.
